- Minion's characteristics change after each interaction with him. There is no time limit in the world of Tamagotchi. The Minion will live as long as the user takes care of it.
- The user can interact with the Minion using the buttons in the footer: `feed`, `sleep`, `wc`, `walk`, `teach`, `clean` and `play`. After executing these commands, the characteristics of the Minion changes.
- The Minion has 3 lifes that he can lose under certain conditions, which the Minion and the system will warn the user about.
- When the Minion dies, the base characteristics are reset and 1 life is spent. With the loss of all lives, the game ends.
- Bonus: Under certain circumstances, Minion can evolve.

The aim is to look after your pet by feeding him and keeping him entertained.
